title: "Summer's Dawn"
text: |
  The rain has hushed its silver song,
  The clouds have parted, drifted long.
  Now sunbeams dance on emerald ground,
  As summer's warmth comes shining down.
  
  The air is light, the skies are wide,
  The world awakes in golden pride.
  From sodden earth, the flowers bloom,
  And chase away the winter's gloom.
  
  A breeze of promise softly hums,
  The solstice calls, the summer comes.
  In radiant days, we’ll bask and play,
  The sun’s embrace will light our way.
